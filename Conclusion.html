			<p id="PlotsTextCon"> In conclusion, the three biggest contributors 
			to the schools with the lowest graduation rates were dropout rate, 
			demographics level, and income.  Even though dropout rate was the 
			highest contributor, it was more of a mathematical contributor 
			rather than an influential contributor.   It is most likely that income 
			level is the biggest contributing influence on the schools, 
			and it's sort of a virtuous cycle.  The cities with the highest income levels 
			can have higher property taxes.  Higher property taxes feed into
			higher school budgets, so these schools can have better books, 
			technology, etc.  But also, people with higher incomes would 
			seek out the cities with better schools, therefore contributing to the cycle.  </p>
